# Budget keeper (Spring/React part)

The purpose of the application is to keep the household budget in check. The project consists of two parts: 
- a Python script that reads emails from the bank and dumps the parsed information into a MySQL database
- **a Spring/React application that allows you to display and edit expenses. In addition, charts and pivots ;)**
